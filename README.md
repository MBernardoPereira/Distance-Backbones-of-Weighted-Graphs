# Distance Backbones of Weighted Graphs

This project comprises the code and final document of my Master Thesis.
The work was done under the supervision of Dr. Luís Rocha at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência and co-supervision of Prof. Pedro Martins Rodrigues at Instituto Superior Técnico of the University of Lisbon.

The code provided was used to compute different distance closures and backbones of real world contact networks and simulate epidemic spreadings on them, namely using SI and SIR models.
